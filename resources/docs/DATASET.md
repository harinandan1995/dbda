## Dataset

The dataset for the model is generated by transforming the vector files provided by [Raster-to-Vector](http://art-programmer.github.io/floorplan-transformation/paper.pdf)
which contains positions of various building elements and room types in a txt file.

Run the following command to transform these vector files into either *tfrecords* or *hdf5* or *png*

    python3 transform.py --config {path_to_the_config}
    
> Default config used is [config/transform.yaml](../../config/transform.yaml)

Note: png files are just for visualization and is not a valid data for training the model

> An already filtered and transformed dataset is available at [datasets](../../datasets/energy/tfrecords) which can be directly used to train the models as shown below
